        <strong>Welcome</strong> to my first <em>website</em>! This is a simple

        Imagine a beautiful summer's day. The birds chirp their individual
        songs; the wind breezes through the glowing green grass. The flowers
        sparkle like diamonds against the bright blue sky. But now imagine all
        this beauty being taken away from you. You can no longer hear the birds
        or see the flowers. You can no longer see or hear anything. This is what
        happened to Helen Adams Keller after succumbing to scarlet fever at the
        mere age of 18 months. Yet in spite of this hardship, Keller was able to
        triumph over hardship. She is an admirable woman of power who deserves
        the Lorax award. I admire Helen Adams Keller for her determination,
        intelligence, and inspirational life lived on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helen Keller’s life exhibits an intelligent mind, model of inspiration.
        For example, before her teacher, Anne Sullivan entered her life: Helen
        wasn’t completely shut off from the world. She did realize she was
        different, but she persevered to work past this handicap. She developed
        her own form of communication. This included such signs as pretending to
        cut a loaf of bread if she was hungry for a slice. Moreover, after Anne
        entered Helen’s life, Helen learned sign language. Remarkably, her first
        comprehended word was "water." She grew up to be an eager student,
        attended Radcliffe, obtained outstanding grades, and even wrote several
        books like inspirational books that has today influenced my life in one
        way or another.
      </p>
      <p>Some of her notable works include:</p>
      <ul>
        <em>
          <li>The Frost King (1891)</li>
          <li>The Story of My Life (1903)</li>
          <li>The World I Live In (1908)</li>
          <li>My Religion (1927)</li>
        </em>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Thus, Helen Keller is indeed a woman of extreme power. She overcame dire
        obstacles to show determination, intelligence, and inspiration in her
        life. She knew that life was only as good as you make it. She overcame
        obstacles that many will never face, learned to take great leaps of
        blind faith and achieved. I celebrate her today.
