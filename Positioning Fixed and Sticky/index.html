    <!-- Here’s why your navbar might not be sticking:✅ 
Your sticky .navbar is wrapped inside <header>, but you only applied position: sticky to .navbar —
if the parent <header> doesn’t play nicely or if it doesn’t stretch across the viewport, the sticky effect might fail. -->

        <h1>Welcome to Our Page</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Every project we take on begins with a clear
          purpose — to solve real problems, elevate brands, and craft meaningful
          digital experiences that matter to both you and your audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Passion:</strong> Our passion fuels everything we do, from the
          first brainstorming session to the final design handoff. We’re not
          just building websites — we’re pouring our creativity and heart into
          work that inspires.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Precision:</strong> We believe the magic is in the details.
          From pixel-perfect layouts to seamless interactions, we ensure every
          element is meticulously aligned to achieve a polished, professional
          finish.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Perseverance:</strong> Great design doesn’t happen overnight.
          We embrace the challenge, working through ideas, testing concepts, and
          iterating tirelessly until we create something we’re truly proud of.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Partnership:</strong> We see every client as a partner on the
          journey. Through open communication and shared vision, we collaborate
          closely to ensure the final product feels authentically yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Progress:</strong> We are passionate about learning, growing,
          and evolving. Whether it’s adopting the latest design trends or
          refining our own processes, we strive for progress with every project
          we touch.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Potential:</strong> We see untapped potential in every brand,
          every concept, every idea. Our mission is to help you unlock that
          potential and transform it into a digital presence that commands
          attention.
